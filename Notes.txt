Since this board isn't the fastest board. I'm installed QEMU on my PC which will run an 8 core RISC-V virtual machine from the command line.

I want to see if building a kernel will be faster being build on a RISC-V virtual machine that the actuall hardware.

Update: 
June 16th

Explaining Computers showcased the board. It's like he says, if it could boot from NVME it would be much faster.

I am working on this now. Will post updates as I have them.
