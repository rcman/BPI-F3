Since this board isn't the fastest board. I'm installed QEMU on my PC which will run an 8 core RISC-V virtual machine from the command line.

I want to see if building a kernel will be faster being build on a RISC-V virtual machine that the actuall hardware.

Explaining Computers showcased the board. It's like he says, if it could boot from NVME it would be much faster.

I am working on this now. Will post updates as I have them.

I found they make a tool for Linux called Clonezilla which will change your initrd 

I haven't tried it yet but if you run it on the banana pi-f3 with an m.2 installed, you boot from your micro sd card and run it - it will 

detect other drives installed on your machine and change the initrd so it uses that storage.

I need o test this. I'll let you know.
