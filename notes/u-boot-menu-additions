To get U-Menu to work add these commands.



CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_KEYED=y
CONFIG_BOOTDELAY=30
CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_MENU_SHOW=y



To scan the discoverable devices connected to the buses such as USB and PCIe prior to bootmenu showing up, CONFIG_PREBOOT can be used to run the command before showing the bootmenu, i.e.:

CONFIG_USE_PREBOOT=y
CONFIG_PREBOOT="pci enum; usb start; scsi scan; nvme scan; virtio scan"
